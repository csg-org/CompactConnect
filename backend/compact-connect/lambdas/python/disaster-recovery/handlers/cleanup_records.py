def cleanup_records(event: dict, context: LambdaContext):  # noqa: ARG001 unused-argument
    """
    As part of synchronizing tables during a DR event, we clear the current records from the target
    table to put it in a clean state. After which the next step in the recovery process will copy over all the
    existing records from the recovery point table into the target table.

    In the event that the deletion process takes longer than the 15-minute time limit window for lambda, we return a
    'deleteStatus' field of 'IN_PROGRESS', causing the step function to loop around and continue the cleanup process.
    If all the records have been cleaned up, we return a 'deleteStatus' of 'COMPLETE', causing the step function to
    proceed to the copy step.
