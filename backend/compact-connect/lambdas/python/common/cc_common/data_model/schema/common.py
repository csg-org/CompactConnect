    Base class for Compact Connect data classes

    These data classes provide an abstraction layer between the data model and the database schema.
    They also provide a simple interface to validate data and get specific properties. They also have utility methods
    to serialize and deserialize database records.

    Whenever possible, data classes should be used to interact with the data model from lambda functions, rather than
    referencing the schemas directly.

    Data classes must be instantiated using one of the class factory methods:
    1. create_new(): For creating a new record that doesn't exist in the database yet
    2. from_database_record(): For loading an existing record from the database

    When putting records into the database, call the serialize_to_database_record method to convert the data class to a
    dictionary using the record schema's dump method.

    Subclasses must define a class-level _record_schema attribute specifying the schema to use.

    Subclasses can also set _requires_data_at_construction = True to prevent empty initialization.
