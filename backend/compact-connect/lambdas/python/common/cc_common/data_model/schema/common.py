    Checks a string value is always returned as a datetime string, even if it is a date string.

    Historically, many of our records were using Date fields to track when records in the system were created.
    This was not sufficient for handling the many different timezone requirements of different states. We have
    since moved to using DateTime fields most of those date fields, except in the case of licenses uploaded by states,
    since states do not specify a time of day for when the license was issued.

    This function is used to ensure that all date fields are converted to datetime fields when they are loaded from the
    database. If an old record is using a date field, it will be converted to a datetime field with the time set to the
    end of the day in UTC time. This is done to ensure that all records are treated consistently by the system.
