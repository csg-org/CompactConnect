    """
    Process settled transactions from the payment processor.

    This lambda is invoked as part of the transaction history processing workflow. It retrieves settled transactions
    from the payment processor and stores them in DynamoDB. It is designed to be invoked multiple times until all
    transactions have been processed. The lambda will return a status of 'IN_PROGRESS' until all transactions have been
    processed, at which point it will return a status of 'COMPLETE'.

    If the payment processor reports that there was a settlement failure, the lambda will return a status of
    'BATCH_FAILURE', which will cause the workflow to send an alert to the compact operations team.

    :param event: Lambda event containing:
        - compact: The compact name
        - lastProcessedTransactionId: Optional last processed transaction ID
        - currentBatchId: Optional current batch ID being processed
        - processedBatchIds: Optional list of batch IDs that have been processed, this ensures we don't process the same
            batch multiple times.
    :param context: Lambda context
    :return: Dictionary indicating processing status and optional pagination info
