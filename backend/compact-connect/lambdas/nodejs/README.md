# NodeJS Lambdas

This folder contains all lambda runtimes that are written with NodeJS/TypeScript. Because these lambdas are each bundled through CDK with ESBuild, we can pull common code and tests together, leaving only the entrypoints in a lambda-specific folder, leaving ESBuild to pull in only needed lib code.


## Prerequisites

## Local development
- **Linting**
    - `yarn run lint`
        - Lints all code in all the Lambda function
- **Running an individual Lambda**
    - The easiest way to execute the Lambda is to run the tests ([see below](#tests))
        - Commenting out certain tests to limit the execution scope & repetition is trivial

## Testing
This project uses `jest` and `aws-sdk-client-mock` for approachable unit testing. The code in this folder can be tested by running:
- `yarn install`
- `yarn test`

or by using the utility scripts located at `backend/bin`.
