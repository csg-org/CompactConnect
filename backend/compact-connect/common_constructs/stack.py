                        few goals:
                        - policy versioning
                        - reusability across resources that perform similar tasks
                        - rolling back on failures
                        - delegating permissions management

                        These goals are met differently in a CDK app. CDK itself allows for granular permissions crafting
                        that is attached to policies directly to each resource, by virtue of its Resource.grant_* methods.
                        This approach actually results in an improvement in the principle of least privilege, because each
                        resource in the app has permissions that are specifically crafted for that particular resource
                        and only allow exactly what it needs to do, rather than sharing, generally more coarse, managed
                        policies that approximate the access it needs to perform particular tasks. Those highly targeted
                        policies are appropriately attached to principals as inline policies. This approach leads to a
                        more maintainable and more secure implementation than the reusability and permissions delegation
                        that managed policies accomplish. Versioning of policies is accomplished through git itself as the
                        version control system that manages all of the infrastructure, runtime code, and policies for the
                        app, right here in this repository. Rolling back on failures is accomplished both through
                        CloudFormation as well as git again, as both have capabilities to perform much more cohesive
                        roll-backs than managed policies alone.
