class SynthSubstituteStage(Stage):
    """
    A lightweight stage used as a substitute during pipeline synthesis.

    This stage is used to optimize CDK pipeline synthesis by replacing
    heavyweight stages with a minimal stage that contains just a single
    SynthSubstituteStack. This dramatically reduces synthesis time when
    only a specific pipeline's stages need to be synthesized.

    Using a separate stage rather than conditional logic within existing
    stages provides an additional safety layer - preventing accidental
    deletion of production resources due to typos in pipeline names.
