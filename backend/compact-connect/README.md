## Prerequisites
[Back to top](#compact-connect---backend-developer-documentation)

To deploy this app, you will need:
1) Access to an AWS account
2) Python>=3.12 installed on your machine, preferably through a virtual environment management tool like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv),
   for clean management of virtual environments across multiple Python versions.
3) Otherwise, follow the [Prerequisites section](https://cdkworkshop.com/15-prerequisites.html) of the CDK workshop to
   prepare your system to work with AWS-CDK, including a NodeJS install.
4) Follow the steps in the [Installing Dependencies](#installing-dependencies) section.

## Environment Config
[Back to top](#compact-connect---backend-developer-documentation)

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app, including configuration specific to any given target
deployment. You can add local configuration that will be merged into the `cdk.json['context']` values with a
`cdk.context.json` file that you will not check in.

This project is set up like a standard Python project. To use it, create and activate a python virtual environment
using the tools of your choice (`pyenv` and `venv` are common).

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

## Installing Dependencies
[Back to top](#compact-connect---backend-developer-documentation)

Python requirements are pinned in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). Install them using `pip`:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template(s) for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

For development work there are additional requirements in `requirements-dev.txt` to install with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add them to the `requirements.in` file and rerun
`pip-compile requirements.in`, then `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.

## Local Development
[Back to top](#compact-connect---backend-developer-documentation)

Local development can be done by editing the python code and `cdk.json`. For development purposes, this is simply a
Python project that can be exercised with local tests. Be sure to install the development requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Note that this project is a cloud-native app that has many small modular runtimes and integrations. Simulating that
distributed environment locally is not feasible, so the project relies heavily on test-driven development and solid
unit/functional tests to be incorporated in the development workflow. If you want to deploy this app to see how it runs
in the cloud, you can do so by configuring context for your own sandbox AWS account with context variables in
`cdk.context.json` and running the appropriate `cdk deploy` command.

## Tests
[Back to top](#compact-connect---backend-developer-documentation)

Being a cloud project whose infrastructure is written in Python, establishing tests, using the python `unittest`
library early will be critical to maintaining reliability and velocity. Be sure that any updates you add are covered
by tests, so we don't introduce bugs or cost time identifying testable bugs after deployment. Note that all
unit/functional tests bundled with this app should be designed to execute with zero requirements for environmental
setup (including environment variables) beyond simply installing the dependencies in `requirements*.txt` files. CDK
tests are defined under the [tests](./tests) directory. Runtime code tests should be similarly bundled within the
lambda folders. Any python lambda functions defined in cdk code that uses the
`common_constructs.python_function.PythonFunction` construct will automatically run bundled tests on synthesis to
facilitate automated testing of the entire app.

To execute the tests, simply run `bin/run_tests.sh` from the `backend` directory.

## Deployment
[Back to top](#compact-connect---backend-developer-documentation)

### First deploy to a Sandbox environment
The very first deploy to a new environment (like your personal sandbox account) requires a few steps to fully set up
its environment:
1) *Optional:* Create a new Route53 HostedZone in your AWS sandbox account for the DNS domain name you want to use for
   your app. See [About Route53 Hosted Zones](#about-route53-hosted-zones) for more. Note: Without this step, you will
   not be able to log in to the UI hosted in CloudFront. The Oauth2 authentication process requires a predictable
   callback url to be pre-configured, which the domain name provides. You can still run a local UI against this app,
   so long as you leave the `allow_local_ui` context value set to `true` in your environment's context.
2) Copy [cdk.context.sandbox-example.json](./cdk.context.sandbox-example.json) to `cdk.context.json`.
3) At the top level of the JSON structure update the `"environment_name"` field to your own name.
4) Update the environment entry under `ssm_context.environments` to your own name and your own AWS sandbox account id,
   and domain name, if you set one up. If you opted not to create a HostedZone, just remove the `domain_name` field.
   The key under `environments` must match the value you put under `environment_name`.
5) Configure your aws cli to authenticate against your own account.
6) Run `cdk bootstrap` to add some base CDK support infrastructure to your AWS account.
7) Run `cdk deploy 'Sandbox/*'` to get the initial stack resources deployed.

### Subsequent sandbox deploys:
For any future deploys, everything is set up so a simple `cdk deploy 'Sandbox/*'` should update all your infrastructure
to reflect the changes in your code. Full deployment steps are:
1) Make sure your python environment is active.
2) Run `bin/sync_deps.sh` from `backend/` to ensure you have the latest requirements installed.
3) Configure your aws cli to authenticate against your own account.
4) Run `cdk deploy 'Sandbox/*'` to deploy the app to your AWS account.

### First deploy to the production environment
The production environment requires a few steps to fully set up before deploys can be automated. Refer to the
[README.md](../multi-account/README.md) for details on setting up a full multi-account architecture environment. Once
that is done, perform the following steps to deploy the CI/CD pipeline into the appropriate AWS account:
- Have someone with suitable permissions in the GitHub organization that hosts this code navigate to the AWS Console
  for the Deploy account, go to the
  [AWS CodeStar Connections](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections) page and create a
  connection that grants AWS permission to receive GitHub events. Note the ARN of the resulting connection for
  the next step.
- Create a new Route53 hosted zone for the domain name you plan to use for the app in each of the production AWS
  account and the test AWS account. See [About Route53 hosted zones](#about-route53-hosted-zones) below for more detail.
- Copy the `cdk.context.production-example.json` file to `cdk.context.json` and update accounts and other identifiers,
  including the Code Star connection you just had created to match the identifiers for your actual accounts and
  resources.
- With the [aws-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), set up your local
  machine to authenticate against the Deploy account as an administrator.
- Run the `bin/put_ssm_context.sh` script to push relevant content from your `cdk.context.json` script into an SSM
  Parameter Store in your Deploy account.
- Set cli-environment variables `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` and `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION` to your deploy account id and
  `us-east-1`, respectively.
- Run the command `cdk deploy PipelineStack` to get the pipeline initial stack resources deployed.

### Subsequent production deploys

Once the pipeline is established with the above steps, deploys will automatically execute to the test and production
environments whenever changes are pushed to the `development` or `main` branches of the repository named in your
`cdk.context.json` file.

### Useful commands

* `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

## Decommissioning
[Back to top](#compact-connect---backend-developer-documentation)

You can tear down resources associated with any of the CloudFormation stacks for this application with
`cdk destroy <stack-name>`. Most persistent resources with data remain in the Persistent stack, so you can freely
destroy the others without losing users or data. If you wish to destroy the Persistent stack as well, be aware that
some resources may be left behind as CloudFormation is designed to err on the side of orphaning resources over data
loss. You can identify any resources that weren't destroyed by watching the stack deletion from the AWS CloudFormation
Console, then looking at the resources after its delete is complete, to look for any with a `Delete Skipped` status.

## About Route53 hosted zones

A Hosted Zone in Route53 represents a collection of DNS records for a particular domain and its subdomains, managed
together. See the [Route53 FAQs for more](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/faqs/). When creating a hosted zone, you have
to also configure the domain name registrar (be it AWS or some other vendor) to point to the name servers associated
with your hosted zone, before the records in the zone will have any effect. When deploying this app, creating a hosted
zone in the AWS account for the UI and API domains is part of the environment setup. If you use the common approach
of having your test environments be a subdomain of your production environments (i.e. `compcatconnect.org` for prod
and `test.compcatconnect.org` for test), you need to delegate nameserver authority from your production hosted zone
(`compactconnect.org` in this example) to your test account's hosted zone (`test.compactconnect.org`). To do this, you
need to create your production hosted zone (`compactconnect.org`) in your production account first, then create your
test hosted zone (`test.compactconnect.org`) in your test account second, then delegate name server authority to your
test subdomain. To do this, find the NS record associated with your test hosted zone and copy its value, which should
look something like:
```text
ns-1.awsdns-19.co.uk.
ns-2.awsdns-18.com.
ns-5.awsdns-15.net.
ns-6.awsdns-16.org.
```

Copy those name server values and, back in your production hosted zone, create a new NS record that matches the test
one, with the same value (i.e. Record Name: `test.compcatconnect.org`, Type: `NS`, Value: `<same as above>`). Once that
is done, your test hosted zone is ready for use by the app.
