## Key
- :arrow_heading_up: Server-hosted only
- :arrow_heading_down: Local development only

---
## Prerequisites
- **[Node](https://nodejs.org/) `22.1.0`**
    * Use **[NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)** to manage Node versions
    * The `curl`-based install script is typically all that's required
    * A brief overview of the [NVM Usage commands](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage) is typically helpful
- **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) `1.22.x`**
    - `npm install --global yarn`

    - Copy the `.env.example` as `.env`
1. Adjust the values in `.env` as needed:
    - **`NODE_ENV`**
        - `production`: for all server environments :arrow_heading_up:
        - `development`: for local development :arrow_heading_down:
    - **`BASE_URL`**
        - `/` to serve under domain root

### Server environment web server :arrow_heading_up:
- **Create a 404 rule that serves the `index.html` page**
    - This is common to modern "single-page-app" (SPA) frontends. It allows the frontend to serve up sub-page routes without the web server throwing a 404 first.
    - The frontend will handle 404 pages as needed
    - Apache example:
        - ```
          <Directory "<...path-to-frontend-dist...>/">
              ...
              FallbackResource /index.html
          </Directory>

          ### Also, omit any other 404 handlers, such as:
          ### ErrorDocument 404 /404/
          ```
- **Depending on the hosting environment, other `4xx` codes may need similar treatment**
    - For instance, AWS S3 will also require a similar rule for 403 responses

---
## Local Development :arrow_heading_down:
1. In a terminal, navigate to  `webroot/`
1. Ensure `.env` is created & up-to-date
1. `yarn install --ignore-engines`
1. `yarn build`
1. `yarn serve`
    - Visit `http://localhost:3018` in your browser
    - Files are watched for changes and the app is re-compiled automatically

### Onboarding
1. **Study `/webroot/src/styles.common/*`**
    - _To get a sense of what styles are available globally_
1. **Study `webroot/src/store/*`**
    - _To get a sense of the available store state / actions / getters_
1. **Study `webroot/src/models/*`**
    - _To get a sense of the available model types and their helper methods_
1. **Study `webroot/src/network/*.api.ts`**
    - _To get a sense of the available endpoint calls_
    - _There is also a Postman collection & environment in `/docs/postman`_
1. **Understand what's injected into Components**
    - Review `main.ts` and the `/plugins` directory

### Blueprints
We've created a CLI tool to help speed up the creation of certain modules, such as Components, Pages & Models.

- In a terminal, navigate to  `webroot/`
- **Create:** `node blueprint create <type> <name> <sub-path>`
- **Destroy:** `node blueprint destroy <type> <name> <sub-path>`
- **Help:** `node blueprint`

### CORS Testing
- This is a standalone single-page frontend (SPA); any server APIs will need to have CORS enabled. You can read more about CORS [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

We've created a CORS testing tool to make quick work of verifying whether CORS has been enabled for a server API:

1. In a terminal, navigate to  `webroot/`
1. `node cors-test.js`
    - Select the Origin domain
    - Enter / paste a server API endpoint
    - Choose the HTTP method you'll be using for the endpoint
1. The output will be the response status & headers
1. CORS requires that the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header must be included and contain a value matching the Origin domain
    - _Rather than simply parsing the headers for the expected value, we return all the headers as they can provide additional clues about any CORS config issues the server may have._


### Static assets
- **/src/assets vs. /public**
    - Prefer the `/src/assets` directory for static assets, such as images, vendor CSS, etc.
    - `/src/assets` files are examined / inlined by the webpack build process as appropriate. Missing images produce a build error before the user notices a 404. CSS under a certain size is auto-inlined to reduce network requests, etc.
    - The `/public` folder in just an escape hatch for one-offs
    - https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/html-and-static-assets.html#static-assets-handling

### Server API Docs

## Tests
### Unit
Unit tests run non-interactively and can be included in automations.

#### Run all tests
1. In a terminal, navigate to  `webroot/`
1. `yarn test:unit:all`

#### Run specific tests
- In a terminal, navigate to  `webroot/`
- `yarn test:unit <path-under-webroot>`
    - _Specific test file:_ `yarn test:unit /src/components/Nav/Nav.spec.ts`
    - _Specific group of files:_ `yarn test:unit /src/components/Nav`
        - _Can also be used a shorthand for specific test file if only 1 exists in directory_
    - [Mocha options](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage) can also be passed in _(e.g. `watch`, `bail`, etc)_

### Coverage
1. In a terminal, navigate to  `webroot/`
1. `yarn test:unit:coverage`

### E2E
Currently, E2E tests run interactively and should not be included in automations.

#### Testing environment variables
1. In `/webroot/`, copy `cypress.env.example.json` to `cypress.env.json`
1. Adjust the values in `cypress.env.json` as needed`

#### Run E2E tests
1. In a terminal, navigate to  `webroot/`
1. `yarn test:e2e`

---
## Build
- In a terminal, navigate to  `webroot/`
- `yarn build`
    - A production-like app structure is created in `webroot/dist`

Note that testing the **built** app locally will require a running web server; file protocol will not work
- Example:
    - ```
      cd webroot/dist
      python3 -m http.server 8001

      ### Visit localhost:8001 in Private / Incognito browser
      ```
- Testing the **built** app should always be done with a Private / Incognito browser window
    - _Otherwise the PWA will get cached and testing a clean state or volatile in-progress work will require lots of manual cache storage clearing._

## Auth
- We use two cognito user pools with hosted login pages to authenticate users as Provider users and Staff users respectively
- Cognito's somewhat opinionated functionality combined with this set up introduces some complexity to make the app function in a secure and expected way

- **Cognito's functionality:**
    - When a user logs in to Cognito, it saves an http only cookie allowing the user to log back in without entering credentials for an hour
    - Cognito has no way to totally log a user out except for visiting the hosted logout url in the browser
        - Using the token revocation endpoint, the user can invalidate their reresh token, but the http only cookie is not removed so if
        they logged in within the last hour they are not totally logged out

- **Two user pools with their own hosted login pages:**
    - If a user is logged in to one user pool, they can still log in to the second as they are not aware of each other
    - The downstream effect of this point is that the app needs to handle users being logged in to both user pools in an expected and secure way:
        - When a user logs out they must be logged out from all user pools they are logged into
        - When a user logs in to the second user pool, the app must treat them as only logged into the second user pool

- **How the app handles this situation:**
    - Firstly, the user being logged into both pools is very unlikely as there is not natural way to do this within the app, they would need to manually visit the
    second hosted login page after logging in normally to the first
    - When the user logs in as to the second user pool we record that the app should treat them as the second user type and save the initial access token
        - When the user logs out we check the existence of the access tokens to see which user pools we need to log out, and then chain logout redirects
        to visit all necessary logout pages
