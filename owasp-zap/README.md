# OWASP Zed Attack Proxy

[ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) is a security pen testing tool, which this project uses for active scanning for vulnerabilities. To manually run a scan similar to the ones integrated into [our GitHub Actions](../.github/workflows), run `./manual-scan.sh` from a command line. For full details on running the scan locally, see [Manual run ](#manual-run). Below is a brief explanation of the pieces of this integration and what they are for.

# Authenticator

The [authenticator](./authenticator) directory is a simple NodeJS script that leverages [aws-amplify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-amplify) to quickly log a test user in and acquire an token for authentication. This script requires that the Cognito UserPool Client be configured to enable the [Secure Remote Pasword (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol) authentication flow as part of a 'VULNERABLE' security profile, which can only be activated in pre-production environments. See [Set up](#set-up) for discussion of the profile.

# Data

The [data](./data) folder contains configuration and automation data files that are used to control ZAP's scan. This includes an HttpSender script and an automation YML file. The HTTPSender script will tell ZAP to add the token we acquired from the [authenticator](#authenticator) script into the `Authorization` header for every 'in scope' request, headed to the UI or API. The YML file defines what jobs are to be run as part of an automated scan.

# Set up

In order for the scan to be able to run successfully, the scanned environment requires some set-up:
1) The target environment backend needs to be deployed with the `"security_profile": "VULNERABLE"` environment context set in order to prevent ZAP from being locked out. The `VULNERABLE` profile weakens a number of security elements to allow for the scan including:
    - Removing the rate limit from the WAF policies
    - Enabling the SRP authentication flow
    - Disabling Cognito Advanced Security
    - Removing MFA requirements

   Because of this loosened security for scanning, the `VULNERABLE` security profile cannot be used in the production environment.
2) Create a dedicated test user in the StaffUsers Cognito UserPool
3) Define the following secrets in the GitHub repository with the corresponding information from the staff user pool, client, and test user:

```
    TEST_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID_STAFF
    TEST_WEBROOT_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID_STAFF
    TEST_ZAP_USERNAME_STAFF
    TEST_ZAP_PASSWORD_STAFF
```

# Manual run

If you wish to run the ZAP scan locally, you can do so buy following these steps:
1) Install `docker` [docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your computer.
2) From inside the [authenticator](./authenticator) folder, copy `env.example` to `.env` and update the example values with the real values from the StaffUser user pool and the test user created in [Set up](#set-up).
3) From the repository root, run `./owasp-zap/manual-run.sh`. The scan will run inside a docker container and the report will be added to a `reports` folder at the repository root.
