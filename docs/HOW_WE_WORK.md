# How We Work

## Vendor pull requests

InspiringApps will work on their own fork of the repository. They will file a pull request against CSG’s `development`
branch upon completion of each feature within a sprint. All pull requests should be filed within one working day of the
end of the sprint, e.g. if the sprint ends on a Thursday, any PRs for work completed within that sprint should be filed
by the end of the day on Friday. Each pull request will be titled for the completed feature
(e.g., `View disciplinary information`), and the description will link back to the story in the backlog, and should
include an illustrative screenshot (where applicable).

The Council of State Governments will review each pull request per the [code review process](./CODE_REVIEW.md), to
ensure that the work is compliance with the contract, and that the code adheres to best practices. CSG will make every
effort to complete that code review within two working days of receiving it from InspiringApps, making that work the
highest priority of the technical lead. Any requested changes etc. from CSG will be made in the spirit of collaboration
and open discussion between CSG and IA, understanding that we are all learning together. When all issues raised in the
code review have been addressed to CSG’s satisfaction, the pull request will be merged.

## Branch strategy

InspiringApps will use feature branches within their fork, and upon completion of that feature, will file a pull
request from that branch to the `development` branch in CSG’s repo. CSG will periodically merge the `development`
branch to `main`, through a process and at a frequency to be determined.


## API Design
As this project progresses, we will be building out a RESTful API to facilitate compact-member board IT systems
integrating with CompactConnect. In order to minimize level of effort for systems integration with our API, we will
do our best to build an API that:
- is secure;
- is intuitive to technical staff;
- is sensible for board staff to use; and
- meets the needs of boards across the compacts using this system.

To that end, we will establish our design principles here that aim to best meet those goals. Note that these are
_principles_, not hard rules. These are intended to help us to meet our API goals, by establishing common stated
priorities, not to constrain our options. That said, here are the principles we will use to guide us:
- We will respect REST API design conventions, as they are described [here](https://restfulapi.net/).
- Once we release a major API version, we will support that api, making only non-breaking changes. Should breaking
  changes be necessary we will incorporate those updates into a new major version and work with clients to gracefully
  migrate to the new major version before deprecating the old major version.
- We will build the API to create a uniform resource naming system that is self-consistent.
- We will design the API to be easy to use correctly and difficult to misuse.
- We will design the API to be idempotent, where applicable.
- Underlying implementation details are secondary to a clean API.
