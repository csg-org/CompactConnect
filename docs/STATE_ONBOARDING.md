# State Onboarding for Compact Connect

Before a state can be onboarded to the Compact Connect system, there are certain steps that must be taken. This document
will outline the steps to onboard a state to the system, and provide further detail for each step 
below.

1. Decide State Fee for a Compact Privilege
2. Upload Current Licensee Data
3. Notify of Current Investigations for Licensees
4. Share State Licensure System Communication
5. Onboard Staff
6. Notify Commission of Jurisprudence Requirements

## Deciding State Fee for a Compact Privilege
The first step in onboarding a state to the Compact Connect system is to decide on the fee that the state will 
charge for a compact privilege. The state must notify the commission regarding this state fee.

### Decide Military Discount
The state must also decide if they will offer a military discount for military affiliated licensees. 
If they choose to do so, they must notify the commission of the discount.

## Upload Current Licensee Data
The state must upload their current licensee data to the Compact Connect system. Currently there are two ways this
data can be uploaded:

### Uploading via the Compact Connect API
The state can upload licensee data via the Compact Connect API. TODO - add reference to API endpoints to use for this.

### Uploading via CSV file
The state can upload licensee data via a CSV file. TODO - explain this process in more detail.

### Test Data Upload
Once the licensee data has been uploaded into the system using one of the methods described above, the state must 
test the data that has been uploaded. Any issues encountered during testing should be resolved with the help of 
state IT and/or Compact Connect software developers.

## Notify of Current Investigations for Licensees
The state must note which licensees are under ongoing investigations. Where applicable, the state must add ongoing
investigation information to fulfill the notification of the 
“existence (only) of current significant investigative information” requirement.

## Share State Licensure System Communication
The state must share their license renewal schedule with the Commission. The state must inform the compact 
commission about the licensing software currently in use.

### Translate License Names
The state must “translate” license names to correlate with names in the system (active/eligible or inactive).

### Translate Adverse Actions
The state must “translate” adverse actions to be categorized as disqualifying encumbrances or non-disqualifying.

## Onboard Staff
The state must appoint staff to work with the compact. The staff will be responsible for uploading license information,
discipline information, and investigation information. This section outlines the process for onboarding staff and 
providing them access to the system.

### Determine Access Levels
Each staff user must be assigned an access level. This determines the access that the staff user has to the system. 
There are currently three levels of access: view data, upload data, and administrator. Users with view data access can
view data in the system, users with upload data access can upload data to the system, and administrators have full access.

### Inviting Staff Users to Use the System
Once a staff user account has been created and granted a certain access level, the system will send out an email to the
staff user providing them temporary login credentials. The staff user must then log in and change their password.

### Train Administrators
Staff users with Administrator access must be trained with the help of Compact Connect and/or the compact commission.
TODO - more information about training process here.

## Notify Commission of Jurisprudence Requirements
The state must notify the commission as to whether or not there are jurisprudence requirements for licensees in a state
(i.e. an assessment of an individual's knowledge of the laws and rules governing the practice of the medical field related to that license).
If jurisprudence requirements exist, the state must inform the commission how those are implemented. If jurisprudence
requirements are required before the privilege is obtained, access must be made available to compact privilege seekers 
outside of a regular application.
